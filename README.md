# Coffeemaker_Testing
This is a testing framework for the Coffeemaker game that I was given in my IT480 class. The game comes in the form of a .jar file.

I put this together for fun, and to see if I even could set up a testing base for something. 

Any feedback on how I have the framework laid out, or any other changes really, would be greatly appreciated as I am still learning the testing side of software. 

## The tests folder will contain files of tests, with each file having one or many tests that all having something in common (a requirement, for example).
